The initial project, The Hrenovator, was created in 2022 with Google Apps Script and was a simple automation app. This app allowed it's users to provide information, goals, routes and equipment for instllation technicians to prepare for their day and succeed. It was deployed throughout the midwest and improved productivty and reduced costs by 30%. Although this tool was simple to use, it was very powerful in it's execution; delivering information and goals, gleaning important data and statistics, providing a compact yet detailed view on an employee's day and simplifying operational tasks. The Hrenovator is where it all started and is the foundation of CodeMaven.</p>
