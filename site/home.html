            <p class="content summary-paragraph" id="summary-summary" tabindex="0">I have coded on and off for the last 30 years; seemingly in a burst of inspiration, curiosity or necessity. From Visual Basic/ASM based TI-8x games to Excel tables to calculate each length and cut of a roof rafter down to saw blade and deck angles, I have always sought to either have fun or simplify my work.  In early 2022, I revisted my joy of coding to accomplish repetitive work tasks. The project, The Hrenovator, was created with Google Apps Script and was a simple automation app. This app allowed it's users to provide information, goals, routes and equipment for installation technicians to prepare for their day and succeed. My employer took notice and soon it was being piloted. It was deployed throughout the midwest and improved productivty and reduced costs by 30%. Although this tool was simple to use, it was very powerful in it's execution; delivering information and goals, gleaning important data and statistics, providing a compact yet detailed view on an employee's day and simplifying operational tasks to enable more time driving prodcutivity. The Hrenovator refreshed my love of coding and is the reason I am continuing my coding journey.</p>
